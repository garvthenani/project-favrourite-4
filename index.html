        <p class="para">My hobby is playing interesting and knowledgeable games in my free time. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to play such games after completing my home work. I am 12 years old and study in class 6th standard. Now I know very well that playing is this habit which can make me refreshed. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. playing games keep one always happy and busy.
